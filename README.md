# Node Similarity Measures in PyTorch Geometric

The code in this repository aims to 
1. implement the node similarity measures introduced in the [A Survey on Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10993) paper

2. replicate (some of) the empirical results

Currently implemented:
- Mean Average Distance (MAD)
- Dirichlet Energy $\sqrt{\mathcal{E}}$
